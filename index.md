# [Grav3m1ndbyte's Resources Blog](index.html)


![Grav3m1ndbyte HTB Badge](https://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/image/75471)




# Purpose of this site:

  This site is meant to help people by sharing the resources I think are useful or have been useful, while giving other people's resources more exposure, which I understand helps them as well. In addition to this, I like to share the paths taken on Hack the Box Machines I had completed. If anything I can be reached in the forum, DMs in Hack The Box or Discord. 

  As [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) members are not supposed to release any write up or walkthrough while machines or challenges are stil Active, I will be updating the content as the machines start to get retired.

  Something I want everyone to keep in mind, what you will go through here is my path to own machines, to complete the challenge, or my usage of tools and resources, not necessarily the only way or the best way. As we are humans, we all can make mistakes or end up going down rabbitholes. In some cases, I will still show some of the mistakes I've done and flag them.

## My advice to you all!

1. Through your learning process, be patient and try not to get frustrated, but if you do, step out for a little bit.
2. Try to enjoy the process.
3. Go to the forum, go to Discord, contact other members that had rooted or completed the boxes. There is a lot of people wiliing to help.
